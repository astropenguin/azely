"""Azely's time module (mid-level API).

This module mainly provides ``Time`` class for date and time information at a
given location (time information, hereafter) and ``get_time`` function to obtain
time information as an instance of ``Time`` class.

The ``Time`` class is subclass of ``pandas.DatetimeIndex`` and expressed like
``Time(['2020-02-18'], dtype='datetime64[ns, Asia/Tokyo]', freq='D')``.

The ``get_time`` function computes time information in several cases:
(1) Current time (e.g., [2020-01-01 22:32:58+09:00]).
(2) Time range today (e.g., [2020-01-01 00:00, ..., 2020-01-02 00:00])
(3) Time range of given date and length (by query)

In the cases of (1) and (2), special queries, ``'now'`` and ``'today'``, must be
specified, respectively. The ``view`` option specifies a timezone where
time (range) is considered (timezone or location name can be accepted).

In the case of (3), formatted query (e.g., ``'2020-01-01 to 2020-01-05'``)
or natural language-like query can be used (e.g., ``'Jan. 1st to Jan. 5th'``),
where start and end must be separated by ``'to'``. The ``view`` option also works.

Examples:
    To get current time in Tokyo::

        >>> time = azely.time.get_time('now', view="Tokyo")

    To get current time in UTC::

        >>> time = azely.time.get_time('now', view="UTC")

    To get time range today at ALMA AOS::

        >>> time = azely.time.get_time('today', view="ALMA AOS")

    To get time range from Jan. 1 to Jan. 5 in 2020 in UTC::

        >>> time = azely.time.get_time('2020-01-01 to 2020-01-05', view='UTC')

    The ``get_time`` function computes time information in several cases:
    (1) Current time (e.g., [2020-01-01 22:32:58+09:00]).
    (2) Time range of today (e.g., [2020-01-01 00:00, ..., 2020-01-02 00:00])
    (3) Time range of given date and length (by query)

    In the cases of (1) and (2), special queries, ``'now'`` and ``'today'``, must be
    specified, respectively. The ``view`` option specifies a timezone where
    time (range) is considered (timezone or location name can be accepted).

    In the case of (3), formatted query (e.g., ``'2020-01-01 to 2020-01-05'``)
    or natural language-like query can be used (e.g., ``'Jan. 1st to Jan. 5th'``),
    where start and end must be separated by ``'to'``. The ``view`` option also works.

    Args:
        query: Query string (e.g., ``'2020-01-01 to 2020-01-05'``).
            If ``'today'`` (by default) or ``'now'`` is specified,
            then time range of today or current time is computed, respectively.
        view: Name of timezone (e.g., ``'Asia/Tokyo'`` or ``'UTC'``) or location
            with which timezone can be identified (e.g., ``'Tokyo'``).
        freq: Frequency of time samples as the same format of pandas offset aliases
            (e.g., ``'1D'`` -> 1 day, ``'3H'`` -> 3 hours, ``'10T'`` -> 10 minutes).
        dayfirst: Whether to interpret the first value in an ambiguous 3-integer
            date (e.g., ``'01-02-03'``) as the day. If True, for example,
            ``'01-02-03'`` is treated as Feb. 1st 2003.
        yearfirst: Whether to interpret the first value in an ambiguous 3-integer
            date (e.g., ``'01-02-03'``) as the year. If True, for example,
            ``'01-02-03'`` is treated as Feb. 3rd 2001.
            If ``dayfirst`` is also ``True``, then it will be Mar. 2nd 2001.
        timeout: Query timeout expressed in units of seconds (see notes).

    Returns:
        Time information as an instance of ``Time`` class.

    Raises:
        AzelyError: Raised if the function fails to parse query or timezone.

    Notes:
        If location is specified as ``view``, then ``azely.location.get_location``
        function is used inside the function, which requires internet connection
        if the location is queried for the first time.

    Examples:
        To get current time in Tokyo::

            >>> time = azely.time.get_time('now', view="Tokyo")

        To get current time in UTC::

            >>> time = azely.time.get_time('now', view="UTC")

        To get time range of today at ALMA AOS::

            >>> time = azely.time.get_time('today', view="ALMA AOS")

        To get time range from Jan. 1 to Jan. 5 in 2020 in UTC::

            >>> time = azely.time.get_time('2020-01-01 to 2020-01-05', view='UTC')
