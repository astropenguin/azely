"""Azely's location module (mid-level API).

This module mainly provides ``Location`` class for location information
and ``get_location`` function to search for location information as an
instance of ``Location`` class.

The ``Location`` class is defined as:
``Location(name: str, longitude: str, latitude: str, altitude: str = '0')``,
where units of lon/lat and altitude are deg and meter, respectively.

The ``get_location`` function acquires location information from:
(1) Guess by IP address (by default). Internet connection is required.
(2) Data from OpenStreetMap. Internet connection is required.
(3) User-defined location information written in a TOML file.

In the case of (1) and (2), obtained location information is cached
in a special TOML file (``~/.config/azely/locations.toml``) for an offline use.

In the case of (3), users can define location information in a TOML file
(e.g., ``user.toml``) which should be put in a current directory or in the
Azely's config directory (``~/.config/azely``). Location information must be
defined as a table in the TOML file like::

    # user.toml

    [ASTE]
    name = "ASTE Telescope"
    longitude = "-67.70317915"
    latitude = "-22.97163575"
    altitude = "0"

Then location information can be obtained by ``get_location(<query>)``.
Use ``get_location(<name>:<query>)`` for user-defined location information,
where ``<name>`` must be the name of a TOML file without suffix or the full
path of it. If it does not exist in a current directory, the function
will try to find it in the Azely's config directory (``~/.config/azely``).

Examples:
    To get location information by IP address::

        >>> loc = azely.location.get_location('here')

    To get location information from OpenStreetMap::

        >>> loc = azely.location.get_location('ALMA AOS')

    To get location information from ``user.toml``::

        >>> loc = azely.location.get_location('user:ASTE')

    """Get location information by various ways.

    This function acquires location information by the following three ways:
    (1) Guess by IP address (by default). Internet connection is required.
    (2) Data from OpenStreetMap. Internet connection is required.
    (3) User-defined location information written in a TOML file.

    In the cases of (1) and (2), obtained location information is cached
    in a special TOML file (``~/.config/azely/locations.toml``) for an offline use.

    In the case of (3), users can define location information in a TOML file
    (e.g., ``user.toml``) which should be put in a current directory or in the
    Azely's config directory (``~/.config/azely``).

    Then location information can be obtained by ``get_location(<query>)``.
    Use ``get_location(<name>:<query>)`` for user-defined location information,
    where ``<name>`` must be the name of a TOML file without suffix or the full
    path of it. If it does not exist in a current directory, the function
    will try to find it in the Azely's config directory (``~/.config/azely``).

    Args:
        query: Query string (e.g., ``'ALMA AOS'`` or ``'user:ASTE'``).
            Default value, 'here', is a special one with which the function
            tries to guess location information by an IP address of a client.
        timeout: Query timeout expressed in units of seconds.

    Returns:
        Location information as an instance of ``Location`` class.

    Raises:
        AzelyError: Raised if the function fails to get location information.

    Examples:
        To get location information by IP address::

            >>> loc = azely.location.get_location('here')

        To get location information from OpenStreetMap::

            >>> loc = azely.location.get_location('ALMA AOS')
