"""Azely's azel module (high-level API).

This module mainly provides ``compute`` function as a high-level API for users
which computes azimuth/elevation of an astronomical object under given conditions.

The ``compute`` function (1) gets object, location, and time information, (2) computes
az/el and LST (local sidereal time), and (3) returns them as a pandas DataFrame.

Object information can be obtained either online (CDS) or offline (an user-defined
TOML file) by query (e.g., ``'NGC1068'`` or ``'Sun'``). Location information can be
obtained either online (IP address or OpenStreetMap) or offline (an user-defined
TOML file) by query (e.g., ``'Tokyo'`` or ``'ALMA AOS'``). Time information can be
computed from either formatted (e.g., ``'2020-01-01'``) and natural language-like
query (e.g., ``'Jan 1st 2020'``). See docstrings of ``get_[object|location|time]``
functions for more detailed query options.

There are two different locations to be used for a computation:
(1) ``site``: location where az/el of an object is computed.
(2) ``view``: location where time information (timezone) is considered.

Examples:
    To compute daily az/el of NGC1068 at ALMA AOS::

        >>> df = azely.compute('NGC1068', 'ALMA AOS', '2020-02-01')

    To compute the same object and location but view from Japan::

        >>> df = azely.compute('NGC1068', 'ALMA AOS', '2020-02-01', view='Tokyo')

    To compute az/el of Sun at noon during an year at Tokyo::

        >>> df = azely.compute('Sun', 'Tokyo', '1/1 12:00 to 12/31 12:00', freq='1D')

As DataFrame has ``plot`` method for matplotlib, plotting the result is so easy::

    >>> df.el.plot() # plot elevation

If users want to use LST instead of time information, use ``in_lst`` property::

    >>> df.in_lst.el.plot()

In order to use LST values as an index of DataFrame, LST has pseudo dates which
start from ``1970-01-01``. Please ignore them or hide them by using matplotlib's
DateFormatter when you plot the result.

    There are two different locations to be used for a computation:
    (1) ``site``: location where az/el of an object is computed.
    (2) ``view``: location where time information (timezone) is considered.

    Args:
        object: Query string for object information (e.g., ``'Sun'`` or ``'NGC1068'``).
            Specify ``'user:NGC1068'`` if users want to get information from ``user.toml``.
        site: Query string for location information at a site (e.g., ``'Tokyo'``).
            Specify ``'user:Tokyo'`` if users want to get information from ``user.toml``.
        time: Query string for time information at a view (e.g., ``'2020-01-01'``).
        view: Query string for timezone information at the view. (e.g., ``'Asia/Tokyo'``,
            ``'UTC'``, or ``Tokyo``). By default (``''``),  timezone at the site is used.
        frame: (object option) Name of equatorial coordinates used in astropy's SkyCoord.
        freq: (time option) Frequency of time samples as the same format of pandas offset
            aliases (e.g., ``'1D'`` -> 1 day, ``'3H'`` -> 3 hours, ``'10T'`` -> 10 minutes).
        dayfirst: (time option) Whether to interpret the first value in an ambiguous
            3-integer date (e.g., ``'01-02-03'``) as the day. If True, for example,
            ``'01-02-03'`` is treated as Feb. 1st 2003.
        yearfirst: (time option) Whether to interpret the first value in an ambiguous
            3-integer date (e.g., ``'01-02-03'``) as the year. If True, for example,
            ``'01-02-03'`` is treated as Feb. 3rd 2001. If ``dayfirst`` is also ``True``,
            then it will be Mar. 2nd 2001.
        timeout: (common option) Query timeout expressed in units of seconds.

    Returns:
        Computed DataFrame of object's az/el and LST at given site and view.

    Raises:
        AzelyError: Raised if one of mid-level APIs fails to get any information.
